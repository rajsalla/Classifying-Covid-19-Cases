# Classifying Severity of Covid-19 Cases Using Machine Learning

The purpose of this project is to classify the severity levels of covid-19 cases into two class which is 'Severe' and 'Non-Severe'.

## Description

This classification of Covid-19 cases will be beneficial for providing adequate treatment to the patient based on the severity levels. With thorugh analysis of data, I have identified five main deciding symptoms i.e. fever, dry cough, tiredness, sore throat and difficulty in breathing which are responsible for deciding the severity of the case. In this project Logistic Regression is used for training the model and have achieved 75% accuracy.
